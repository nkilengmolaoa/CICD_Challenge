# CICD_Challenge
For my CI/CD Challange, I have created a Bakery Website.

The steps taken from my side are as follows
Create repo --> CICD_Challenge
Clone Repo
Create HTML + CSS in order to have the front end of my web page done.
Create test.yaml for automated testing once I have pushed any changes to my repo.
Create deploy.yaml to push any web changes to GitHub pages as soon as they are pushed to my repo.
